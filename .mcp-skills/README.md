This directory contains reusable code patterns and analyzers that Claude Code can use to accelerate development.

## Philosophy

Your codebase IS the memory. These skills help Claude analyze and reuse existing patterns more efficiently.

## Available Skills

- **adapter-pattern-analyzer.py** - Analyze existing adapters to extract common patterns
- **test-pattern-matcher.py** - Find similar test structures for new adapters
- **coverage-analyzer.py** - Quick coverage gap analysis
