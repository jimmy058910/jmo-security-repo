# Bandit configuration for jmo-security-repo
# Goal: keep Bandit strict on source code while reducing noise in tests/docs/samples

# Exclude non-source directories from recursive scans
exclude_dirs:
  - .venv
  - venv
  - docs
  - samples
  - assets
  - archive
  - tests

# Do not globally skip tests; we handle targeted skips via Makefile for tests/ only.
skips:
  - B404  # import subprocess is expected in CLI wrappers
  - B606  # os.startfile usage is guarded and platform-specific

# Set minimum severity/confidence thresholds for reporting (default is LOW/HIGH)
# Keep defaults by commenting these out; uncomment to raise thresholds if needed.
# severity: MEDIUM
# confidence: HIGH
