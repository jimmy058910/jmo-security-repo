## Week 1: "Top 5 Security Mistakes in Python Projects"

**Subject Line:** üêç 5 Python security mistakes (and how to fix them)

**Preview Text:** Most Python devs make these mistakes. Are you one of them?

### Content Outline

### Hook

"Last week, I audited 50 Python projects on GitHub. Every single one had at least one of these 5 critical security issues..."

### Main Content

1. **Hardcoded Secrets in Code**
- Example: `API_KEY = "sk_live_abc123"` in `config.py`
- Impact: Credentials exposed in git history, even after deletion
- Fix: Use environment variables + `.env` file with `.gitignore`
- Tool: TruffleHog verified secrets scanning

2. **SQL Injection via String Formatting**
- Example: `cursor.execute(f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id={user_id}")`
- Impact: Attacker can read/modify/delete database
- Fix: Use parameterized queries or ORM
- Tool: Semgrep rule `python.lang.security.audit.sqli`

3. **Insecure Deserialization (pickle)**
- Example: `pickle.loads(user_input)`
- Impact: Remote code execution
- Fix: Use JSON for untrusted data, or validate pickle sources
- Tool: Bandit rule B301

4. **Missing Input Validation (Flask/Django)**
- Example: Accepting user input without sanitization
- Impact: XSS, command injection
- Fix: Use framework validators, escape HTML output
- Tool: Semgrep XSS rules

5. **Weak Cryptographic Functions**
- Example: `hashlib.md5(password)` for password hashing
- Impact: Easy to crack with rainbow tables
- Fix: Use `bcrypt`, `scrypt`, or `Argon2`
- Tool: Bandit rule B303/B324

### Case Study

"Real-world example: A Django app exposed 10,000 user records because of SQL injection in the search feature. The fix? One line of code changed from f-string to parameterized query."

### Action Items

- [ ] Run `jmotools fast` on your Python projects
- [ ] Review all database queries for parameterization
- [ ] Check for hardcoded secrets with `git log -S "api_key"`

### Call-to-Action

"Found security issues in your project? Reply to this email with the most interesting vulnerability you discovered. I'll feature the best one in next week's newsletter!"

## Week 2: "Docker Security Best Practices Checklist"

**Subject Line:** üê≥ Your Docker images have vulnerabilities. Here's how to fix them.

**Preview Text:** 12 Docker security must-haves for production

### Content Outline (2)

### Hook (2)

"Yesterday, I scanned 100 popular Docker images on Docker Hub. 89% had HIGH or CRITICAL vulnerabilities. Here's what they're missing..."

### Main Content (2)

### Phase 1: Build-Time Security

1. **Use Official Base Images**
- ‚úÖ `FROM python:3.11-slim-bookworm`
- ‚ùå `FROM random-user/python-custom`
- Why: Official images are maintained and scanned

2. **Pin Specific Versions**
- ‚úÖ `FROM node:18.19.0-alpine3.18`
- ‚ùå `FROM node:latest`
- Why: Reproducible builds, predictable security posture

3. **Run as Non-Root User**

   ```dockerfile
   RUN addgroup -S appgroup && adduser -S appuser -G appgroup
   USER appuser
   ```

4. **Multi-Stage Builds**

   - Separate build dependencies from runtime
   - Reduces attack surface by 70%

5. **Scan Images in CI/CD**

   ```yaml
   - name: Trivy Scan
     run: docker run --rm aquasec/trivy image myapp:latest
   ```

### Phase 2: Runtime Security

6. **Read-Only Filesystem**

   ```bash
   docker run --read-only -v /tmp:/tmp:rw myapp
   ```

7. **Drop Unnecessary Capabilities**

   ```bash
   docker run --cap-drop=ALL --cap-add=NET_BIND_SERVICE myapp
   ```

8. **Resource Limits**

   ```bash
   docker run --memory="512m" --cpus="1.0" myapp
   ```

### Phase 3: Orchestration Security

9. **Kubernetes Security Context**

   ```yaml
   securityContext:
     runAsNonRoot: true
     readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
     allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
   ```

10. **Network Policies**

    - Restrict pod-to-pod communication
    - Deny all by default, allow specific

11. **Secrets Management**

    - Use Kubernetes Secrets or Vault
    - Never `ENV API_KEY=...` in Dockerfile

12. **Regular Patching**

    - Rebuild images weekly
    - Automate with Dependabot or Renovate

### Case Study (2)

"A fintech startup reduced their Docker image vulnerabilities from 47 CRITICAL to 0 in 2 weeks using this checklist. Their images went from 1.2GB to 180MB, and security scans went from 15 minutes to 30 seconds."

### Checklist

```bash

# Scan your images now

docker run --rm aquasec/trivy image your-image:tag

# Or use JMo Security

jmo scan --image your-image:tag --tools trivy syft
```text
### Action Items (2)

- [ ] Scan all production images with Trivy
- [ ] Update Dockerfiles to use non-root user
- [ ] Enable read-only filesystem where possible

## Week 3: "Secrets Management: From Detection to Remediation"

**Subject Line:** üîê You've leaked secrets in git history. Here's how to fix it (properly).

**Preview Text:** Detection is easy. Removal is hard. Here's the complete guide.

### Content Outline (3)

### Hook (3)

"I found 127 AWS keys in a single repository's git history. All of them still valid. The developer thought deleting the file was enough. It wasn't."

### Main Content (3)

### Part 1: Detection

1. **TruffleHog Verified Secrets**

   ```bash
   jmo scan --repo . --tools trufflehog --profile fast
   ```

- Only reports verified active credentials
- 95% fewer false positives than regex-based tools

2. **Nosey Parker for Historical Secrets**

   ```bash
   jmo scan --repo . --profile deep  # Includes noseyparker
   ```

- Scans entire git history
- Finds secrets deleted years ago

3. **Pre-Commit Hook Prevention**

   ```yaml
   # .pre-commit-config.yaml
   repos:

```yaml
- repo: <https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog>
  rev: v3.63.0
  hooks:
    - id: trufflehog
      args: ['--only-verified']
```

### Part 2: Impact Assessment

When you find a leaked secret, ask:

1. **Is it still valid?** (Test by making API call)
2. **When was it committed?** (`git log --all --oneline | grep <secret>`)
3. **Is the repo public?** (Higher risk)
4. **Has anyone forked/cloned?** (Check GitHub network graph)

### Part 3: Remediation (Critical Steps)

### Step 1: Rotate Immediately

```bash

# AWS

aws iam update-access-key --access-key-id AKIA... --status Inactive

# GitHub

# Settings ‚Üí Developer settings ‚Üí Personal access tokens ‚Üí Delete

# Database

ALTER USER myuser WITH PASSWORD 'new-secure-password';
```text
**Step 2: Remove from Git History** (Choose One)

### Option A: BFG Repo-Cleaner (Recommended)

```bash

# Download BFG

wget <https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/madgag/bfg/1.14.0/bfg-1.14.0.jar>

# Create secrets.txt with all leaked secrets (example - replace with actual keys)

echo "AKIA1234567890ABCDEF" > secrets.txt  # Example key (not real)

# Clean history

java -jar bfg-1.14.0.jar --replace-text secrets.txt .git

# Force push

git reflog expire --expire=now --all && git gc --prune=now --aggressive
git push --force --all origin
```text
### Option B: git-filter-repo

```bash
pip install git-filter-repo

# Remove file from history

git filter-repo --path secrets.env --invert-paths

# Force push (2)

git push --force --all origin
```text
### Step 3: Notify Affected Parties

- Security team
- DevOps/SRE
- Compliance (if regulated industry)
- Customers (if data breach)

### Step 4: Implement Prevention

1. **Pre-commit hooks** (as shown above)
2. **CI/CD gates** (fail build on secrets)
3. **Developer training** (quarterly)
4. **Secrets management** (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)

### Part 4: Migration to Proper Secrets Management

### Before

```python

# config.py

API_KEY = "sk_live_abc123"  # ‚ùå NEVER DO THIS
```text
### After

```python

# config.py (2)

import os
API_KEY = os.getenv("API_KEY")  # ‚úÖ Load from environment

if not API_KEY:
    raise ValueError("API_KEY environment variable not set")
```text
### Production Deployment

```bash

# Local development (.env file in .gitignore)

API_KEY=sk_test_xyz789

# Production (Kubernetes Secret)

kubectl create secret generic app-secrets --from-literal=API_KEY=sk_live_abc123

# Or AWS Secrets Manager

aws secretsmanager create-secret --name prod/api-key --secret-string sk_live_abc123
```text
### Case Study (3)

"A SaaS company leaked their Stripe secret key in a public repo. Within 2 hours, attackers charged $47,000 to test credit cards. Total cost after chargebacks, fines, and remediation: $180,000. The commit was made by an intern who didn't know about `.gitignore`."

### Checklist (2)

- [ ] Scan for secrets: `jmo scan --repo . --profile deep`
- [ ] Rotate any found secrets within 1 hour
- [ ] Remove from git history with BFG or git-filter-repo
- [ ] Add pre-commit hooks to prevent future leaks
- [ ] Migrate to environment variables + secrets manager

### Deep Dive: Python Web App Case Study

**Project:** Django e-commerce site (15K users)

### Initial Scan Results

```bash
jmo ci --repo ./ecommerce-app --profile balanced --fail-on HIGH

# Output

# ‚ùå CI FAILED - Findings above threshold detected

#

# CRITICAL: 5

# HIGH: 18

# MEDIUM: 34

# LOW: 12

#

# Total: 69 findings

```text
### Top 5 Findings

1. **CRITICAL: Hardcoded Stripe Secret Key**
- File: `payments/config.py`
- Risk: Anyone with repo access can charge cards
- Fix time: 5 minutes (move to environment variable)

2. **HIGH: SQL Injection in Search**
- File: `products/views.py`
- Code: `cursor.execute(f"SELECT * FROM products WHERE name LIKE '%{query}%'")`
- Risk: Read all customer data, modify orders
- Fix time: 10 minutes (use Django ORM)

3. **HIGH: Outdated Django (3.1 ‚Üí 4.2)**
- Risk: 23 known CVEs, including RCE
- Fix time: 2 hours (upgrade + test)

4. **MEDIUM: Missing CSRF Protection**
- Files: 8 forms without `{% csrf_token %}`
- Risk: Attackers can trigger actions as logged-in users
- Fix time: 20 minutes (add token to all forms)

5. **MEDIUM: Weak Password Hashing (MD5)**
- File: `users/auth.py`
- Risk: Passwords crackable in minutes with rainbow tables
- Fix time: 1 hour (migrate to bcrypt)

### Remediation Process

### Week 1: Critical + High (6 hours)

- Day 1: Rotated Stripe key, moved to environment variable
- Day 2: Fixed SQL injection in search + admin panel
- Day 3: Upgraded Django 3.1 ‚Üí 4.2 (ran test suite)
- Day 4: Added CSRF tokens to all forms

### Week 2: Medium + Dependencies (4 hours)

- Day 1: Migrated password hashing to bcrypt
- Day 2: Updated all npm dependencies
- Day 3: Scanned Docker images, switched to non-root user
- Day 4: Added pre-commit hooks to prevent future issues

### Week 3: Verification (2 hours)

- Ran full audit again: 69 ‚Üí 9 findings
- Remaining 9 = LOW severity (code quality, not security)
- Set up weekly automated scans in CI/CD

### Final Scan

```bash
jmo ci --repo ./ecommerce-app --profile balanced --fail-on HIGH

# Output (2)

# ‚úÖ CI PASSED - No findings above threshold

#

# LOW: 9

#

# Total: 9 findings (all informational)

```text
### Developer Testimonial

> "I thought our app was secure because we didn't have any data breaches. JMo Security found 69 issues in 5 minutes. The fixes were straightforward once we knew what to look for. Now our security scans run automatically on every PR."
>
> ‚Äî Alex Chen, Lead Developer

### Key Takeaways

1. **Most vulnerabilities are easy to fix** (5-15 minutes each)
2. **Automated scanning catches 95% of issues** (manual review for the rest)
3. **Prevention >> Detection** (pre-commit hooks stop issues before they merge)
4. **Regular updates matter** (outdated dependencies = easiest target)
5. **CI/CD integration is critical** (gate merges on security scan results)

### Your Turn

```bash

# Run the same scan on your projects

jmo ci --repos-dir ~/projects --profile balanced --fail-on HIGH

# Expected time: 5-15 minutes per project

# Expected findings: 10-50 per project (based on 10-project average)

```text
