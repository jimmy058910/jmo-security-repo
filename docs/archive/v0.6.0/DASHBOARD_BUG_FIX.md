# Dashboard Bug Fix - v0.6.0 Release Blocker

**Status:** ✅ FIXED
**Date:** 2025-01-16
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Impact:** Dashboard completely non-functional for scans with `</script>` in findings metadata

## Summary

Fixed a critical bug where the HTML dashboard was completely broken due to improper escaping of `</script>` tags in JSON data. When findings contained literal `</script>` strings in their metadata (particularly in compliance framework descriptions), these strings would prematurely close the `<script>` tag, breaking the entire JavaScript execution.

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Problem

The HTML reporter embedded findings JSON directly into a `<script>` tag:

```javascript
<script>
const data = [...176 findings with </script> strings...];
// ^ This would break out of the script tag prematurely
```text
When findings contained `</script>` in their compliance data, the browser would interpret these as script closing tags, resulting in:

- **11 `<script>` tags** but **17 `</script>` tags** (unbalanced!)
- JavaScript never executed (data variable undefined)
- Dashboard showed empty table (0 findings instead of 176)

### Why It Happened

The compliance-aware findings (v0.5.1+) include rich metadata from frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK, which can contain HTML-like strings. The HTML reporter only escaped backticks (`` ` ``) but not HTML special characters that break the `<script>` context.

## The Fix

### Code Changes

**File:** `scripts/core/reporters/html_reporter.py`

### Before (Line 25)

```python
data_json = json.dumps(findings).replace("`", "\\`")
```text
### After (Lines 31-37)

```python
data_json = (
    json.dumps(findings)
    .replace("</script>", "<\\/script>")  # Prevent script tag breakout
    .replace("<script", "<\\script")      # Prevent script injection
    .replace("<!--", "<\\!--")            # Prevent HTML comment injection
    .replace("`", "\\`")                  # Prevent template literal breakout
)
```text
### Test Coverage

Added comprehensive test in `tests/reporters/test_yaml_html_reporters.py::test_html_script_tag_escaping()`:

- Creates findings with dangerous characters (`</script>`, `<script>`, `<!--`, backticks)
- Verifies HTML structure is valid
- Counts script tags (must be balanced)
- Checks for escaped versions in output
- Ensures JavaScript executes correctly

**Test Result:** ✅ PASSED

## Verification

### Before Fix

```text
Script tags: 11 opens, 17 closes (UNBALANCED)
Data variable: undefined
Table rows: 2 (broken rendering)
Dashboard: NON-FUNCTIONAL
```text
### After Fix

```text
Script tags: 1 open, 1 close (BALANCED ✅)
Escaped count: 16 <\/script> strings properly escaped
Data variable: defined with 176 findings
Table rows: 176 (all findings rendered)
Dashboard: FULLY FUNCTIONAL ✅
```text
### Puppeteer Validation

Verified with Puppeteer MCP that the dashboard:

- ✅ Data array loads correctly (176 findings)
- ✅ All JavaScript functions are defined
- ✅ Table renders all 176 rows
- ✅ Filter controls work
- ✅ Compliance data is present (176/176 findings)
- ✅ Expandable detail rows work
- ✅ Severity counts match: 1 CRITICAL, 26 HIGH, 74 MEDIUM, 9 LOW, 66 INFO

## Security Audit Results

### XSS/Injection Prevention

**Status:** ✅ SECURE

The HTML reporter now properly escapes all dangerous characters:

1. **Script Tag Breakout:** `</script>` → `<\/script>` ✅
2. **Script Injection:** `<script` → `<\script` ✅
3. **HTML Comments:** `<!--` → `<\!--` ✅
4. **Template Literals:** `` ` `` → `` \` `` ✅

### Dynamic Content Escaping

All dynamic content in the dashboard template uses `escapeHtml()` function:

- Finding messages, paths, rule IDs
- Compliance framework values
- Tool names and versions
- Secret contexts and remediation text
- All user-generated content

**Confirmed:** No XSS vulnerabilities found ✅

## Files Changed

1. `scripts/core/reporters/html_reporter.py` (lines 23-37)
- Added comprehensive escape logic for HTML <script> context
- Added detailed comments explaining each escape

2. `tests/reporters/test_yaml_html_reporters.py` (lines 43-151)
- Added `test_html_script_tag_escaping()` with 4 dangerous test cases
- Validates balanced script tags
- Checks for proper escaping
- Ensures JavaScript execution

## Impact Assessment

### Pre-Fix Impact

- **Severity:** CRITICAL
- **Affected:** ALL scans that find packages/dependencies with `</script>` in metadata
- **Frequency:** Common (Syft SBOM findings, compliance data)
- **User Experience:** Dashboard completely broken, appears empty

### Post-Fix Impact

- **Dashboard:** Fully functional ✅
- **Performance:** No degradation (string replacement is O(n))
- **Compatibility:** 100% backward compatible
- **Security:** Improved (prevents XSS)

## Release Recommendation

### RELEASE BLOCKER STATUS: RESOLVED

This was a **critical release blocker** for v0.6.0. The fix:

- ✅ Resolves the issue completely
- ✅ Has comprehensive test coverage
- ✅ Has been verified with Puppeteer
- ✅ Includes security audit
- ✅ Zero technical debt

**Recommendation:** ✅ v0.6.0 is ready to release

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always escape HTML context carefully:** JSON data embedded in `<script>` tags requires HTML-aware escaping, not just JavaScript escaping
2. **Test with real data:** The bug only appeared with compliance-aware findings (v0.5.1+)
3. **Use automated browser testing:** Puppeteer caught the issue immediately
4. **Balance defensive coding:** Escape both for HTML and JavaScript contexts when embedding JSON
