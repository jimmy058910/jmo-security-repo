## What's in this toolkit

- Orchestrates secrets (TruffleHog verified, Nosey Parker), SAST (Semgrep, Bandit), SBOM+vulnerabilities (Syft, Trivy), IaC (Checkov), Dockerfile (Hadolint), DAST (OWASP ZAP), runtime security (Falco), and fuzzing (AFL++) scanners via a unified CLI
- Normalizes outputs into a CommonFinding schema (v1.0.0) for consistent reporting with stable fingerprinting
- Ships human-friendly HTML dashboard (XSS-secured) and machine-friendly JSON/YAML/SARIF 2.1.0 (enriched with taxonomies)
- Supports profiles, per-tool flags/timeouts, retries, include/exclude patterns, and fine-grained suppression
- Type-safe severity enum (CRITICAL > HIGH > MEDIUM > LOW > INFO) with comparison operators

## Start here

1. Verify environment

```bash
make verify-env
```

1. Run a quick scan

```bash
jmo ci --repos-dir ~/repos --profile-name fast --fail-on HIGH --profile --human-logs
```

1. Open the dashboard (results/summaries/dashboard.html)

- Learn more about features and profiling: [User Guide ‚Äî SARIF and HTML dashboard](USER_GUIDE.md#sarif-and-html-dashboard)

Note: CI runs on ubuntu-latest and macos-latest across Python 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12, with concurrency and job timeouts to keep runs fast and reliable.

## ü™ü Windows Users Quick Start

**Windows has three options - choose based on your skill level:**

### ‚úÖ Recommended: Docker Desktop OR WSL 2

Both options provide full 11+ tool support. Native Windows only supports 6 tools (55% coverage).

**Docker Desktop (Easiest - 5 minutes):**

- Download: <https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop>
- Pull image: `docker pull ghcr.io/jimmy058910/jmo-security:latest`
- Run scan (PowerShell): `docker run --rm -v "${PWD}:/scan" ghcr.io/jimmy058910/jmo-security:latest scan --repo /scan --results /scan/results --profile balanced --human-logs`
- View results: `start results\summaries\dashboard.html`
- **Key Windows syntax:** Use `${PWD}` (with curly braces) and quotes

**WSL 2 (Best Performance - 15 minutes):**

1. Install WSL 2 (PowerShell as Admin): `wsl --install`
2. Restart, then launch Ubuntu from Start Menu
3. Update packages: `sudo apt-get update -y && sudo apt-get upgrade -y`
4. Install dependencies: `sudo apt-get install -y build-essential git jq python3 python3-pip curl wget`
5. Install JMo: `pip install jmo-security`
6. Add to PATH: `echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc`
7. Auto-install tools: `git clone https://github.com/jimmy058910/jmo-security-repo.git && cd jmo-security-repo && make tools`
8. Run scan: `jmotools balanced --repos-dir ~/projects`
9. View results: `explorer.exe results/summaries/dashboard.html`

**Performance tip:** Use WSL filesystem (`~` paths) instead of Windows filesystem (`/mnt/c/`) for 2-3x faster scans.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Native Windows (NOT recommended):**

- Only 6 out of 11+ tools work (55% coverage)
- Missing DAST (ZAP), runtime security (Falco), fuzzing (AFL++), Hadolint, Nosey Parker
- You will miss 20-30% of vulnerabilities
- Only use if Docker/WSL prohibited by organization

## WSL quick install checklist

If you're on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), this gets you to green fast:

- Use WSL2 with Ubuntu 20.04+ (22.04+ recommended)
- Update core packages: `sudo apt-get update -y && sudo apt-get install -y build-essential git jq python3 python3-pip`
- Verify environment and get tool hints: `make verify-env`
- Optional curated tools install/upgrade: `make tools` and `make tools-upgrade`
- Nosey Parker (native, recommended on WSL): see [User Guide ‚Äî Nosey Parker on WSL](USER_GUIDE.md#nosey-parker-on-wsl-native-recommended-and-auto-fallback-docker)
- Ensure `~/.local/bin` is on PATH (for user-local tools): `echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc`

## FAQ

Q: Tools not found or partial toolchain installed?

- A: Run `make verify-env` for OS-aware hints. You can also run with `--allow-missing-tools` to generate empty stubs and still exercise the pipeline.

Q: No repositories detected when using `--repos-dir`?

- A: Only immediate subfolders are considered repos. Ensure each contains a `.git` folder or pass `--repo` for a single path, or `--targets` file.

Q: YAML output missing?

- A: Install `pyyaml` to enable the YAML reporter. Otherwise JSON/MD/HTML still work; see [User Guide ‚Äî Troubleshooting](USER_GUIDE.md#troubleshooting).

Q: Scans are slow on large directories?

- A: Use the `fast` profile, increase `threads`, and consult `timings.json` by running `jmo report --profile`. See [User Guide ‚Äî Configuration](USER_GUIDE.md#configuration-jmoyml).

Q: How do I suppress false positives?

- A: Create a `jmo.suppress.yml` as described in [User Guide ‚Äî Suppressions](USER_GUIDE.md#suppressions). A summary is written to `SUPPRESSIONS.md` during report/ci.

## Why These Tools? (v0.5.0 Tool Selection Rationale)

### Why TruffleHog over Gitleaks?

**Decision:** Removed Gitleaks, kept TruffleHog as primary secrets scanner

**Rationale:**

- **Verification Advantage:** TruffleHog actively verifies secrets against 800+ service APIs, eliminating **95% of false positives**
- **Precision:** 74% precision (TruffleHog) vs 46% precision (Gitleaks) in academic benchmarks
- **Platform Coverage:** TruffleHog scans Git repos, Docker images, S3 buckets, Slack, and 17+ platforms; Gitleaks is code-only
- **Actionable Results:** `--only-verified` flag provides verified credentials that actually authenticate, not just pattern matches
- **False Positive Reduction:** 70-80% reduction in triage time compared to pattern-only scanners

**Use Case:** Run TruffleHog with `--only-verified` in CI/CD for zero-false-positive secrets detection

---

### Why Remove TFSec?

**Decision:** Removed TFSec completely, consolidated to Trivy

**Rationale:**

- **Deprecated:** TFSec acquired by Aqua Security in July 2021, fully merged into Trivy
- **Official Statement:** TFSec GitHub repository explicitly states "tfsec is now part of Trivy"
- **Zero New Development:** TFSec is in maintenance mode with zero new features
- **100% Redundant:** Trivy inherited TFSec's entire Terraform scanning engine (154 policies)
- **Superior Coverage:** Trivy provides **322 total IaC policies** (vs TFSec's 154) plus container scanning, vulnerability detection, and SBOM generation

**Migration:** All TFSec functionality available in Trivy's IaC scanning mode

---

### Why Remove OSV-Scanner?

**Decision:** Removed OSV-Scanner, kept Trivy as primary vulnerability scanner

**Rationale:**

- **Container Limitation:** OSV-Scanner's documented weakness in scanning containerized applications is a showstopper for modern DevSecOps
- **Vendor-Aware Detection:** Trivy handles backported fixes correctly (e.g., Red Hat patches CVEs in older package versions without version number changes)
- **Layer-Aware Scanning:** Trivy identifies which container layer introduced vulnerabilities, OSV-Scanner cannot
- **OS Package Coverage:** Trivy provides superior OS package vulnerability coverage with vendor-specific advisories (RHEL, Debian, Ubuntu)
- **42Analytics Testing:** OSV-Scanner misses vulnerabilities in language-specific libraries installed within Docker images

**Use Case:** Trivy for container-based workflows, OSV-Scanner optional only for pure source code scanning

---

### Why Keep Nosey Parker (Deep Profile Only)?

**Decision:** Kept Nosey Parker in deep profile despite tool consolidation goals

**Rationale:**

- **Best-in-Class Precision:** 98.5% precision (best of all secrets scanners per Praetorian testing)
- **ML-Powered Denoising:** Finds secrets TruffleHog misses (266 vs 197 true positives in research)
- **Complementary Coverage:** ML approach catches patterns verification-based scanners miss
- **Deep Profile Philosophy:** Accept longer scan times for maximum coverage in comprehensive audits
- **Use Case:** Historical repository audits, compliance scans, security audits requiring exhaustive coverage

**Trade-off:** Slightly higher tool count in deep profile for significantly better coverage

---

### Why Keep Bandit (Deep Profile Only)?

**Decision:** Kept Bandit in deep profile for Python-specific edge cases

**Rationale:**

- **Unique Findings:** Real-world Zulip testing showed 10% of findings unique to Bandit
- **68 Refined Checks:** Python-specific checks refined over years from OpenStack Security Project
- **Confidence Ratings:** Provides both confidence and severity ratings (Semgrep only has severity)
- **Edge Case Coverage:** Detects patterns Semgrep misses (e.g., Django `QuerySet.extra()` usage, capitalized environment variables)
- **Deep Profile Philosophy:** Maximize coverage, not minimize tool count

**Alternative:** Organizations can consolidate to Semgrep Pro for multi-language SAST, accepting 5-10% edge case detection loss

---

### Why Add OWASP ZAP (DAST)?

**Decision:** Added OWASP ZAP to balanced + deep profiles

**Rationale:**

- **Critical Gap:** Static analysis (SAST) misses environment-specific issues and runtime vulnerabilities
- **20-30% More Vulnerabilities:** DAST finds an average of 20-30% more vulnerabilities than SAST alone (industry research)
- **Runtime Testing:** Detects authentication bypass, session hijacking, business logic flaws, production misconfigurations
- **API Coverage:** 83% of web traffic is APIs, ZAP provides REST API and GraphQL testing
- **Free + Mature:** 12,000+ GitHub stars, Apache 2.0 license, active community

**Use Case:** Run ZAP in test environments during build stage (15-30 min)

---

### Why Add Falco (Runtime Security)?

**Decision:** Added Falco to deep profile for container/Kubernetes security

**Rationale:**

- **Zero-Day Detection:** Static scanning (Trivy) only catches known vulnerabilities; runtime security detects zero-day exploits
- **eBPF-Based Monitoring:** Kernel-level visibility without overhead
- **Container Escapes:** Detects container escape attempts, privilege escalation, unauthorized file access
- **CNCF Graduated:** Industry-standard runtime security for Kubernetes (used by major enterprises)
- **Policy Violations:** Real-time detection of policy violations during execution

**Use Case:** Continuous monitoring in production Kubernetes environments

---

### Why Add AFL++ (Fuzzing)?

**Decision:** Added AFL++ to deep profile for coverage-guided fuzzing

**Rationale:**

- **Unknown Vulnerabilities:** Fuzzing discovers bugs that traditional testing misses (not pattern-matching)
- **10,000+ Bugs Found:** Google's OSS-Fuzz has found 10,000+ bugs in critical open-source projects using AFL-based fuzzing
- **Coverage-Guided:** Mutates inputs to maximize code path exploration (smarter than random fuzzing)
- **Proven Track Record:** Most advanced fork of American Fuzzy Lop with feedback-based mutation engine

**Use Case:** Nightly fuzzing runs on 3-5 critical components (parsers, input handlers, cryptographic functions)

---

### Why Trivy as Multi-Purpose Champion?

**Decision:** Trivy is the core of all three profiles

**Rationale:**

- **Multi-Purpose:** Vulnerabilities, container security, IaC scanning, secrets detection (secondary), SBOM generation
- **Lightning Fast:** Scans complete in seconds (critical for CI/CD)
- **Inherited TFSec:** Complete Terraform scanning engine from deprecated TFSec
- **Container-Native:** Layer-aware scanning, vendor-aware detection, Docker/OCI image support
- **Low False Positives:** Conservative secrets scanning, backport-aware vulnerability detection

**Use Case:** Run Trivy in all profiles for speed + breadth of coverage

---

### Profile Philosophy

**Fast (3 tools):** Best-in-breed tools for each major category (secrets, SAST, SCA/container/IaC)

- Use Case: Pre-commit checks, quick validation, CI/CD gates (5-8 minutes)

**Balanced (7 tools):** Production-ready comprehensive coverage with DAST

- Use Case: CI/CD pipelines, regular audits, production scans (15-20 minutes)

**Deep (11 tools):** Maximum coverage accepting tool overhead for exhaustive detection

- Use Case: Security audits, compliance scans, pre-release validation (30-60 minutes)

---

### Industry Validation

**Survey Data (2024-2025):**

- 74% of organizations want toolchain consolidation (GitLab Global DevSecOps Survey)
- Best-in-class teams use 6-8 tools orchestrated through ASPM platforms
- Organizations with 11+ tools report highest false positive rates

**OWASP DevSecOps Maturity Model:**

- Level 2 (Walk): 5-7 tools (our balanced profile)
- Level 3 (Run): 6-8 tools orchestrated (our approach)

**Key Principle:** One excellent tool beats three mediocre tools. Prioritize developer experience and low false positives over tool count.
