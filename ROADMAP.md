**Why Third:** Establishes quality baseline before adding more features.

**Objective:** Enable full pre-commit hook coverage in CI while keeping PR feedback fast.

**Current State:**

- CI runs structural checks only (actionlint, yamllint)
- Full hook set available locally via `.pre-commit-config.yaml`

**Full Hook Set:**

- Basic: trailing-whitespace, end-of-file-fixer, check-yaml, check-json, check-toml, mixed-line-ending, detect-private-key, check-added-large-files
- YAML: yamllint (`.yamllint.yaml`)
- Actions: actionlint

**Why Fourth:** Essential for PR reviews and CI/CD workflows, builds on Docker foundation.

**Objective:** Compare scan results across time/commits to identify new/resolved findings and track security trends.

**Key Use Cases:**

- **PR Reviews:** "Show only NEW findings introduced by this PR"
- **Trend Analysis:** "Are we getting better or worse over time?"
- **Sprint KPIs:** "How many findings did we fix this sprint?"

**Implementation:**

```bash
# PR diff workflow
jmo diff main-results/ pr-results/ --output pr-diff.md
# Shows: 3 new, 1 resolved, 2 unchanged

# Sprint retrospective
jmo diff sprint-14-results/ sprint-15-results/ --format html

# Continuous monitoring
jmo diff --baseline week-1/ week-2/ week-3/ week-4/
```

**Diff Algorithm:**

1. Load findings from both directories
2. Match by fingerprint ID (stable deduplication)
3. Classify: New, Resolved, Unchanged, Modified
4. Generate report with summary tables

**Output Formats:**

- JSON (machine-readable)
- Markdown (human-readable tables)
- HTML (interactive dashboard with filters)

**Implementation Phases:**

### Phase 1: Core Diff Engine (Week 1)

**Scope:** Foundation for fingerprint-based comparison

2. Create `scripts/core/diff_engine.py`:
   - `load_findings(results_dir)` - Reuse `gather_results()` logic
   - `compare_findings(baseline, compare)` - Match by fingerprint ID
   - Classification logic: `new`, `resolved`, `unchanged`, `modified`
   - Handle edge cases: missing directories, empty scans
3. Support baseline comparison (multiple directories for trend analysis)
4. Core data structures:
   ```python
   DiffResult = {
       "new": List[Finding],       # In compare, not in baseline
       "resolved": List[Finding],  # In baseline, not in compare
       "unchanged": List[Finding], # Same fingerprint, same severity

   - `write_diff_markdown(diff_result, output_path)` - Human-readable tables
   - `write_diff_html(diff_result, output_path)` - Interactive dashboard
2. JSON format:
   ```json
   {
     "summary": {
       "new": 3, "resolved": 1, "unchanged": 10, "modified": 0,
       "baseline_dir": "main-results/", "compare_dir": "pr-results/"
     },
     "by_severity": {
       "CRITICAL": {"new": 1, "resolved": 0},
       "HIGH": {"new": 2, "resolved": 1}
     },
     "findings": {
       "new": [...], "resolved": [...], "unchanged": [...], "modified": [...]
     }
   }
   ```
3. Markdown format:
   - Summary table with counts
   - Detailed tables by status (new/resolved/modified)
   - Grouped by severity within each section
4. HTML dashboard:
   - Interactive filters (severity, status, tool)
   - Sortable tables
   - Diff visualization (red for new, green for resolved)
   - Reuse existing `html_reporter.py` patterns

**Deliverables:**

**Why Seventh:** Builds on plugin system, provides advanced flexibility for teams.

**Objective:** Enable custom security gating policies using Open Policy Agent (OPA) Rego language for context-aware rules beyond simple severity thresholds.

**Key Benefits:**

- Flexibility (different requirements per team/project)
- Context-aware (gate on paths, repos, finding age, tool combinations)
- Compliance (encode regulatory requirements as testable policies)
- Gradual adoption (strict on new code, relaxed on legacy)

**Example Policies:**

Path-based gating:

```rego
# Block HIGH+ findings in src/, allow in tests/
deny[msg] {
    finding := input.findings[_]
    finding.severity == "HIGH" or finding.severity == "CRITICAL"
    startswith(finding.location.path, "src/")
    msg := sprintf("HIGH+ finding blocked in src/: %v", [finding.ruleId])
}
```

CWE-specific requirements:

```rego
# Zero tolerance for SQL injection (CWE-89)
deny[msg] {
    finding := input.findings[_]
    finding.tags[_] == "CWE-89"
    msg := sprintf("SQL injection detected: %v at %v:%v", [
        finding.ruleId, finding.location.path, finding.location.startLine
    ])
}
```

**CLI:**

```bash
# Basic usage
jmo report ./results --policy my-policy.rego

# Install curated policy
jmo policy install owasp-top-10
jmo report ./results --policy ~/.jmo/policies/owasp-top-10.rego

# Test policy
jmo policy test my-policy.rego
jmo policy dry-run my-policy.rego ./results

# Generate template
jmo policy init --template zero-secrets > my-policy.rego
```

**Policy Marketplace:**

- `owasp-top-10.rego` - OWASP compliance
- `pci-dss.rego` - PCI-DSS requirements
- `hipaa.rego` - HIPAA compliance
- `zero-secrets.rego` - No secrets allowed

**Deliverables:**

- OPA integration with `--policy` flag
- Policy testing and dry-run commands
- Curated policy marketplace (5+ policies)
- Policy authoring guide and cookbook

        "finishedOn": "2025-10-13T10:35:45Z"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**CLI:**

```bash
# Generate and sign attestation
jmo attest results/findings.json --sign --keyless --output attestation.json

# Verify attestation
jmo verify results/findings.json --attestation attestation.json

# Auto-attest in CI
jmo ci --repo . --attest --results results/
```
