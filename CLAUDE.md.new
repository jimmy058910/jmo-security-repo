## Project Overview

JMo Security Audit Tool Suite is a terminal-first, cross-platform security audit toolkit that orchestrates multiple scanners with a unified Python CLI, normalized outputs, and an HTML dashboard. The project scans repositories for secrets, vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and security issues using industry-standard tools.

**Current Version:** v0.9.0 (v1.0.0 in development - 6/13 features complete)

**Key Philosophy:**

- Two-phase architecture: **scan** (invoke tools, write raw JSON) → **report** (normalize, dedupe, emit unified outputs)
- Unified CommonFinding schema with stable fingerprinting for deduplication
- Profile-based configuration for different scan depths (fast/balanced/deep)
- **SQLite historical storage** for trend analysis and security posture tracking (v1.0.0)
- **Machine-readable diffs** for regression detection and PR reviews (v1.0.0)
- **Statistical trend analysis** with Mann-Kendall validation (v1.0.0)
- Resilient to missing tools with fallback mechanisms
